# OpenMW Special Advantages/Disadvantages Mod

Inspired by the custom class creation of Daggerfall, the Special mod for OpenMW (>0.49) allows to customize a Morrowind character beyond what race/class/birthday provide.
The goal of the mod is to allow to have unique builds based on the background and innate capabilities of a character.

For instance, a breton that had a thief as father figure can be more agile than the standard breton while lacking in wisdom.
A nord descending from a family of smiths can have a resistance to fire because they worked the forge daily.
A orc raised as scholar may be unable to use any type of weapons effectively but may be a proficient mage.
And so on...

## Installing

1. Download the mod.
2. Unzip it.
3. Add the directory where the mod was unzip to OpenMW.
4. Enable both the `special.esp` and the `special.omwscripts` files.

## Using it

In game, press the `U` button to open the Specials window. The buttons `Add Special Advantages` and `Add Special Disadvantages` allow to open the window where special traits can be selected. To select a special trait double click on it.
To remove a trait double click on it when in the main window.
